# Areas to Review
The following criteria are to be used for determining if the merge request is acceptable. As different developers will have different personal criteria for what “acceptable” means, this list is intended to give all students common minimum standard to meet.

Comments that address criteria beyond those listed are allowed and encouraged as long as they are constructive and intended to improve the development skills of the developer. However, these cannot be used as a reason to deny the merge request. If in doubt, please discuss with the instructor. 
## Design
*	Does the code follow the Model-View-Controller pattern?
*	Does static analysis pick up any important errors?

## Run-time
*	Do the unit tests pass?
*	Are there significant memory leaks in the program? (leaks in test suite are acceptable)
*	Does the build pass?

## Documentation
*	Is the documentation generated for the system’s interfaces clear and complete?
*	Are the classes, methods, and fields reasonably named?
